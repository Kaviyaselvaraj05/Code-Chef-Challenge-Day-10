01)Chef gives Party
Chef wants to give a burger party to all his 
𝑁
N friends i.e. he wants to buy one burger for each of his friends.

The cost of each burger is 
𝑋
X rupees while Chef has a total of 
𝐾
K rupees.

Determine whether he has enough money to buy a burger for each of his friends or not.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer 
𝑇
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains the three integers 
𝑁
N, 
𝑋
X, and 
𝐾
K - the number of Chef's friends, the cost of each burger, and the total money Chef has, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if the Chef can give a party to all his 
𝑁
N friends. Otherwise, output NO.

You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).

02)Time Complexity
A sorting algorithm 
𝐴
A is said to have more time complexity than a sorting algorithm 
𝐵
B if it uses more number of comparisons for sorting the same array than algorithm 
𝐵
B.

𝐴
A uses 
𝑋
X comparisons to sort an array and algorithm 
𝐵
B uses 
𝑌
Y comparisons to sort the same array, find whether algorithm
